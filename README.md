Pumpkin Knight is my Halloween project for 2025.
It was inspired by a game I’ve always loved playing — MediEvil.
All assets used are free assets obtained from the Unity Asset Store.
The main goal of creating this game was to test myself — it was my personal two-week game jam, which ended on November 1st.
The game currently has only two levels, but I’m not ruling out the possibility of developing it further even after the deadline.

Have fun playing!
